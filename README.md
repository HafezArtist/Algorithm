## ✨ Features

- ✅ Implementation of common algorithms like binary search, sorting, and more.
- 🔢 Mathematical problem-solving scripts (e.g., factorial, triangle).
- 📊 Graphical representation using matplotlib in the triangle.py script.

---

## Requirements

- ⚙️Python 3.7 or higher
- 🐍Libraries:
  -  `matplotlib`
  -  `turtle`

---

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Algorithm-main.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Algorithm-main
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   - **On Windows**:
     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **On macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required library:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

---

## 📖 Usage

Each script is standalone and can be executed directly. Use the following command to run a script:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

### Example:

To run the `triangle.py` script, which uses `matplotlib` for graphical output, use:

```bash
python triangle.py
```
